Tech Stack:

Java: Core business logic and object-oriented programming for creating entities like Customer, Account, Transaction.
Spring Boot: A framework to build and deploy the application quickly, with embedded Tomcat server support and an opinionated approach to configuration.
Database: We can use MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing banking records like customers, accounts, and transactions.
JPA/Hibernate: ORM tool for interacting with the database, managing CRUD operations on entities.
Key Components of the Banking System:

Customer Management: Handles operations such as adding new customers, updating details, and viewing customer profiles.
Account Management: Enables creating and managing accounts (Savings, Checking, etc.), viewing account balances, and closing accounts.
Transaction Management: Processes deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. Spring Bootâ€™s transactional management ensures data consistency.
Security: Implements Spring Security to handle authentication (login/logout) and authorization (different roles such as customer, admin).
Exception Handling: Uses Spring's global exception handler to handle issues like insufficient balance or invalid operations gracefully.
RESTful APIs:

The banking system exposes RESTful APIs for interacting with the frontend or other services.
Endpoints:
/api/accounts/{id} - Fetch account details.
/api/customers/{id} - Fetch customer details.
/api/transactions - Handle transfers, deposits, withdrawals.
These APIs can be tested using tools like Postman or Swagger.
Sample Workflow:

Customer Onboarding: A customer signs up, creating a new profile in the system.
Account Creation: The system automatically generates a new account for the customer, assigning an account number.
Transaction Processing: Customers can deposit, withdraw, or transfer money between accounts. These operations are processed through services ensuring transactional integrity.
